# Favorite Movies List

## This list accomplishes the following tasks:
1. The movie list is created as a functional component with a successful use of the `useState` hook.
2. Every movie title has a feature that toggles additional details. In this scenario, it is a brief description of the movie. This description is triggered by the click of a “next movie“ button at the bottom of the screen.
3. There is a remove button implemented next to each movie title. When the button is clicked, the movie title is removed from the list.
4. Finally, there is a genre toggle button at the top of the screen. As specified by the assignment, the button toggles between all movies, and those movies that have an action genre.

Although the assignment does not require it, I did attempt to make the remove function applicable to the shortened list. By shortened, I mean once the list is filtered by the action genre, it becomes a shorter list. Although the remove buttons are still present, they do not work because the indexing does not follow appropriately. That being said, this program accomplishes all the tasks noted in the assignment.
